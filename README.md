# Factors Influencing Unemployment: A Cross-Country Analysis  

## Overview  
This report analyzes the economic and social factors affecting unemployment across various countries using **World Bank** data. It examines key indicators such as **GDP growth, youth unemployment, labor force participation, inflation, urbanization, trade openness, and capital formation** to identify the primary drivers of unemployment.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing, linearity checks, and diagnostic tests (heteroscedasticity, normality) to ensure robustness.  
- **Regression Techniques:** **Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net** applied to address multicollinearity and improve model stability.  
- **Model Performance:** The final model explains **60.4% (RÂ² = 0.604)** of the variance in unemployment rates.  

## Key Findings  
- GDP growth, inflation, and labor force participation are significant factors.  
- Penalized regression methods improved model interpretability by refining variable selection.  
- Some variance remains unexplained, indicating potential external factors or nonlinear relationships.  

## Conclusion  
This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing unemployment, supporting policymakers in making data-driven decisions to manage labor market challenges effectively.
